# Simplify Over Commenting

Another edict passed on from old is the importance of commenting your code. This really is quite important when writing 
machine language or even assembly. But, since we are probably not, perhaps its time for a little blasphemy.

One of a programmer’s jobs is to understand the language they are using. If they understand the language and see the code in 
front of them why is there a need to add comments? Comments add noise to a code file, comments can get stale, comments reduce 
the amount of code visible at one time. But, most importantly, comments excuse poor, overly complicated or convoluted code. If 
your code requires comments to explain, perhaps its time to re-write it instead.

A much better tool for creating readable code than commenting is elegant naming and code structure. A class’s name should make 
it apparent what it is; a method name should make it apparent what it does. The implementation of the method should be clear 
and concise.
