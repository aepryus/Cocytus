# 5. Simplify Over Commenting

Another decree from back in the day is to _"always comment your code"_. And perhaps when writing Assembly code this _is_ really important.  But, since we are probably not, perhaps its time for a little blasphemy.

One of a programmer’s jobs is to understand the language they are using. If they understand the language and see the code in 
front of them why is there a need to add comments? Comments add noise to a code file, comments can get stale, comments reduce 
the amount of code visible at one time. But, most importantly, comments excuse poor, overly complicated or convoluted code. If 
your code requires comments to explain, perhaps its time to re-write it instead.

Much better than highly commented code is concise, elegant code with elegant structure and well named classes, methods and variables.  A class’s name should make it apparent what it is; a method name should make it apparent what it does. The implementation of methods should be clear and concise.

Certainly, there will be times when comments are actually needed, but that should be the exception not the rule.
