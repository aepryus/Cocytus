# 6. Don’t Solve Problems You Don’t Have

As a programmer it is good to be thinking about performance when coding and to not waste resources unnecessarily.  However, 
there will always be many ways to solve a problem and while one of those ways is the most performant, perhaps many if not all 
of them are performant enough.

In general, the starting point should always be simple and clean code; don’t worry about performance until a performance 
problem arises; i.e., avoid premature optimization.

But, this concept can be applied more generally, not just to performance and other computer resources such as memory, storage, 
battery usage, networking bandwidth etc.  It can also apply to functionality both of the code and more broadly to the 
program’s user interface itself.

Don’t try to predict the future.  Design your program to meet the current requirements, not requirements that may or may not 
exist in the future.
