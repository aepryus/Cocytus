# Don’t Blindly Follow Rules

Religion, conventional wisdom and fad have no place in software development; especially for competent developers. Of course 
the demand for software developers way outstrips the supply, so perhaps this doesn’t pertain to everyone. But, for good 
developers, it is best to consider each situation individually.

‘Don’t ever use goto!’ If there was never a case to use goto in C, than why did they add it to the language? No programming 
rule is right in 100% of cases and certainly none of the guidelines presented here is right in 100% of cases.

Never stop thinking, never stop trying to improve upon what currently exists.
