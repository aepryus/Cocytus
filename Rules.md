# 7. Don’t Blindly Follow Rules

Rules and religion can be useful tools for software developers.  But experienced and competent developers should not be afraid to leave them behind and consider whether they make sense on a case by case basis.

‘Don’t ever use goto!’ If there was never a case to use goto in C, than why did they add it to the language? No programming 
rule is right in 100% of cases and certainly none of the guidelines presented in THIS guide are right 100% of the time.

Don't turn off your brain and cede decisions to some old book.  Never stop thinking; never stop trying to come up with a better way.
