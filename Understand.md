##Don’t Include Code You Don’t Understand

This may (hopefully) seem like a pretty obvious guideline, but certainly at times when deadlines loom and a code snippet from 
StackOverflow looks suspiciously promising, it can be tempting to plop it into place. But, the chances of this creating 
problems, bugs, unmaintainable code down the line is high. Ultimately, this will steal time not save it.

Taking the time to understand the code, or better yet, taking the time to rewrite the code in an understandable way will be 
hugely beneficial later.
